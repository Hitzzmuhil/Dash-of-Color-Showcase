## My Contributions
- Implemented a SUPERHOT-inspired time-stop mechanic allowing players to pause gameplay and dynamically recolor the environment for tactical planning.
- Designed and programmed a color-based collision system (bounce, solid, pass-through) that alters physics behavior and enables intentional collisions for speed boosts and shortcuts.
- Built core gameplay systems including player movement, physics-based knockback, reset, and fall-off-track handling to support high-speed chaotic racing.
- Designed multi-level progression and mechanic-driven tutorialization that teaches systems through level layout rather than explicit UI.
- Coordinated Alpha, Beta, and Gold builds and integrated playtest feedback into gameplay iteration.
